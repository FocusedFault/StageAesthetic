# Overview
- All normal stages except for Commencement (so not including any Hidden Realms or other stages that don't advance the stage count once you clear them) will roll for either vanilla or a variant. Commencement has a single variant that will always be on. If desired, any color scheme (including the vanilla stage) can be disabled in config.
- If a variant is selected, changes are made to post-processing (mostly Ramp Fog and Color Grading), global lighting, individual props and even entire material sets to alter the stage's appearance. For example, the variants included for Titanic Plains are inspired from various trailers - an orange one from very early footage of the game, and an overcast one vaguely similar to the console trailer.
- Once a variant is used, it cannot be chosen for the next time the stage is loaded unless there are no other options.
- Some unused stage props (most notably the border statues in Abandoned Aqueduct) may be enabled.
- The mod currently features **59** visual variants.

# To-do
- Add more variants
- Add Risk of Options support

# Known Bugs
- Stages that variants with texture changes bug out completely *sometimes*, making everything appear pink. I REAAAALLY need some super uber mega giga ultrachad experienced modder to step in here as I have no idea how to fix this
- - Seems to be random
- - Happens uncommonly
- - Only affects some materials (usually terrain materials, or conjoined materials in Sulfur Pools' case???)
- SERIOUSLY please heeeeeelp with the bug above, this is hell

- Light effects on the crystals in Night Distant Roost do not have shadows. This is vanilla behavior, and I've decided to leave it in to aid visibility
- Certain stages still have clashing spots on the skybox. Probably most notable in Rallypoint Delta
- The water in Rallypoint Delta does not change color with the stage. I have no idea how to fix this
- Setting Titanic Plains Bridge Chance to 100% makes no interactables spawn. I have no idea how to fix this

# Shoutouts
- FMRadio11 for the codebase
- SSM24 and Moffein for figuring out the networking ! !
- Everyone who provided variant ideas (HIFU, FMRadio11, Jaysian, breadguy, Slipskip, Heyimnoop). Having existing content to work with is significantly easier even if it's just basic color ideas
